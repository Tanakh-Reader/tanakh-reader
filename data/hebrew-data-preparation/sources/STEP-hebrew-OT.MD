Translators Hebrew Old Testament, 2019.
Created by scholars at Tyndale House, Cambridge (www.TyndaleHouse.com). Based on:

* text of Leningrad B19a with Qere variants created by Westminster College, via OpenScriptures

* semantic tagging by OpenScriptures.org which is linked to BDB lexicon

The semantic tags are backwardly compatible with standard Strongs numbers, and augmented by OpenScriptures for about 800 words additionally found in BDD,

The semantic tags are also extended to include prefixes, suffixes and punctuation marks, as defined in the Hebrew lexicon TBESH at https://tyndale.github.io/STEPBible-Data/

* morphological tagging based on ETCBC database converted to Westminster-style morphology using method at https://goo.gl/yKaXQq#HebMorph2

The mophology codes are based on those defined by OpenScriptures, with a few corrections by Tyndale scholars - see https://goo.gl/HP4mZQ#HebMorph

These data sets have been occasionally been changed and corrected by Tyndale scholars, especially regarding:

* Morphological tags for Ketiv text, because the ETCBC dataset gives morphology for the Qere variants

* Corrections of the Hebrew text when inspection of high-resolution facsimiles of the Leningrad found differences

* Changes in the Semantic tagging by comparison with other systems taggings and applying a consistent approach to various options
