## Notes

convert_csv_data_v3 drops row 16563 from the BHSA df rather than skipping it in data comparison. It also computes the changes to OHB rather than manually doing it. Also removes unecessary items and keeps the two columns in saving the OHB_EXTENDED csv. 

Some of the paragraph divisions are unhelpful. For example, rank 5 produces 
2 Chr 6:1-23. See the chapter for better splittings, e.g. 6:1-11; 6:12-42
Other examples are 1 Kings 21:27 - 22:40; Num 36:1 - Deut 2:1; 

Many instances of book overlap, e.g., Ezra 10:31 - Neh 1:11

Abundant paragraph markers, e.g., Ezra 10 has a marker after almost every verse. 

The hardest passage is Ezra 6:13-18. Why? It is in *Aramaic*. 

Books lacking paragraph markers (for the most part):
* Ruth
* Eccl
* Obadiah
* Psalms
* Prov

## TODO
Options
* Determine a better method for discovering pericopes.
* Continued use of paragraph markers.

Changes needed to the paragraph parser, *get_paragraphs()* (DONE):
* Check if the verse is a book-end, if so then end the passage.
* Cut the Psalms in chapters; Ps 119 into 8vs sections (for loop with i % 8 = 0).

Cleanup 
* Go to output and if a passage is > *x* words, split it up manually and get the weights of the new items, then update the table.
