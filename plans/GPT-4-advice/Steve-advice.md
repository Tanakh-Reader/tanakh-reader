## Game Plan

It's great to hear that you have a clear vision for your reading app. Let me break down a game plan for you to implement the tech stack and deliver a top-notch app.

App design and user experience:
First, focus on the app's design and user experience (UX). Sketch out the overall layout and flow, keeping in mind the specific needs of your target audience. Make sure the design is clean, intuitive, and minimalistic.

Project structure and organization:
Organize your project into modular components, ensuring that the code is maintainable and scalable. Use the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architectural pattern to separate the UI, business logic, and data layers.

Implement the Flutter and Dart SDKs:
Begin by setting up your development environment, installing the necessary tools and packages for Flutter and Dart. Create the app's basic structure and pages using Flutter's widgets and components.

Implement Firebase services:
Set up Firebase for your app and integrate Firestore DB for storing the Hebrew Old Testament text and lexemes collection. Use Firebase Authentication for handling user registration, sign-in, and authentication.

Data caching with Hive:
Integrate the Hive package to cache data locally on the user's device. This will help in reducing the app's reliance on the network and provide a smooth reading experience, even when offline.

State management using Riverpod:
Incorporate the Riverpod package to manage the app's state effectively. This will allow you to handle data changes and UI updates in a clean and efficient manner.

Optimize the app's performance:
Ensure that your app is optimized for performance, with smooth scrolling and quick load times for the content. Use efficient algorithms and data structures for searching and filtering the text.

User progress tracking:
Implement a system for users to track their reading progress, save their favorite verses, and create personalized lexemes collections.

Testing and debugging:
Conduct thorough testing of the app, including unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests. Fix any bugs or performance issues you come across.

Iterate and refine:
Gather feedback from beta testers and potential users. Iterate on the design and functionality of the app based on their feedback. Continuously refine the app to ensure that it meets the needs of your users.

Launch and marketing:
Finally, launch your app on the app stores and invest in marketing efforts to reach your target audience. Offer a compelling value proposition and consider offering incentives or promotions to encourage users to try your app.

Remember to stay focused on your vision, embrace simplicity, and be relentless in your pursuit of excellence. Good luck!

## How should all of those pieces fit together as far as repository structure, especially with MVVM in mind. 

Root level folders:
Create separate folders for the major components of your app, such as lib, assets, test, and documentation. The lib folder will contain all your Dart code, while assets will store images, fonts, and other static resources. test is where you'll write your testing code, and documentation will include any necessary documentation for your app.

Organize the lib folder:
Divide the lib folder into subfolders that represent the different layers and components of your app:

models: This folder will contain classes that represent the data structures and entities of your app, such as the Word and Lexeme objects.
views: Here, you'll store the Flutter widgets that make up the app's UI. Organize this folder further by creating subfolders for each major part of your app, like home, reading, and profile.
viewmodels: This folder will contain the logic for each view. The viewmodels will communicate with the models and services, and expose the data needed by the views.
services: Place all service classes, such as Firebase, Hive, and any other APIs or third-party integrations, in this folder.
providers: Store the Riverpod providers in this folder. Providers will be responsible for creating and disposing of viewmodels and services.
utils: Add utility functions, constants, and other app-wide helpers in this folder.
widgets: Create reusable widgets that can be used across your app in this folder.
Organize the assets folder:
Subdivide the assets folder into subfolders like images, fonts, and data to store the corresponding resources.

Organize the test folder:
Structure the test folder in a way that mirrors the organization of the lib folder, with subfolders for models, views, viewmodels, and services. This will make it easier to locate and maintain your test code.

Use meaningful file and class names:
Ensure that your file and class names are descriptive and follow a consistent naming convention, such as camelCase for file names and PascalCase for class names. This will make it easier to navigate your codebase.

In summary, a well-structured repository will make your code more maintainable, scalable, and easier to understand. By following these guidelines and keeping the MVVM architecture in mind, you'll be well on your way to building a high-quality app.

## Do you have feedback for my current /lib structure?
Positive feedback:

The separation of concerns is well done. You have separated data, UI components, and utilities into their respective folders, which is a good practice.
Your folder structure is quite modular, with subdirectories for various database types and UI components, which makes it easier to find specific files and components.
Suggestions for improvement:

It looks like you have some duplicate file names, such as settings.dart, settings copy.txt, streak.txt, and authentication copy.dart. It's a good idea to remove or rename these files to avoid confusion.
You have a file named TODO.txt in the lib/ directory. It might be better to use a project management tool or an issue tracker to track your tasks and progress, rather than including a TODO file in the codebase.
In the lib/data/database folder, there are two separate folders for firebase-firestore and firebase-realtime. If you are using only one of these databases in your project, consider removing the unused folder to avoid confusion.
It is a good practice to have all your provider files in one folder (e.g., lib/data/providers), but you seem to have a hebrew_passage copy.dart file in that folder. It's unclear whether this file is being used or if it's a leftover copy. You should remove or rename this file to avoid confusion.
In the lib/ui/screens and lib/ui/components folders, you have some subfolders for specific screens, while other screen files are located directly in the parent folder. For consistency, consider creating subfolders for all screens, or move all screen files to the parent folder, depending on the level of complexity of the components.
Overall, your project structure is quite good and follows many best practices. Just by addressing the few suggestions mentioned above, you can make it even better and more consistent, which will be beneficial for the long-term maintainability of your codebase.


## Tips for organizing my DBs?

It is generally not recommended to have direct calls to different databases within the same provider. Mixing calls to different databases in the same provider can make the code harder to maintain, test, and scale.

Instead, you can consider the following approaches:

Repository pattern: Create separate repositories for each database (Firestore and SQL) and abstract the data access logic into these repositories. The provider will then interact with the repositories instead of directly making calls to the databases.
For example, create an abstract class called BibleRepository, and then create two separate classes implementing this abstract class, one for Firestore (e.g., FirestoreBibleRepository) and one for the SQL database (e.g., SQLBibleRepository). The provider can then depend on the BibleRepository abstraction, and you can inject the appropriate repository implementation during runtime.

Combining data: If you need data from both databases for a specific feature, you can create a separate method or service that combines the data from both repositories and provides the combined data to the provider. This way, the provider doesn't need to know about the underlying databases, and the logic for combining data is isolated in a separate class or method.
By separating the data access logic from the provider and using abstractions, you can make your code more modular, maintainable, and easier to test. Additionally, this approach allows you to swap or modify data sources with minimal changes to the provider code.
